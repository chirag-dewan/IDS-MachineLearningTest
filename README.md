# Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning techniques. It leverages a synthetic dataset to simulate network traffic and employs a Random Forest classifier to distinguish between benign and malicious activities.

## Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Uses `make_classification` to simulate network traffic with an imbalanced dataset (90% benign, 10% malicious).
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implements a Random Forest classifier to detect potential intrusions.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Provides a classification report and confusion matrix to assess model performance.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable to use real-world datasets like NSL-KDD or UNSW-NB15.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chirag-dewan/IDS-project.git
   cd IDS-project
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the IDS script:**
   ```bash
   python ids.py
   ```

2. **Output:**  
   The script will generate synthetic data, train the model, and display a classification report and confusion matrix in the console.

## Project Structure
- `ids.py`: Main Python script that contains the IDS implementation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- Additional directories may be added later as the project expands (e.g., for datasets, experiments, and visualizations).

## Future Enhancements
- **Real-World Data:** Integrate real IDS datasets to improve model accuracy.
- **Additional Models:** Experiment with other machine learning algorithms such as SVM, logistic regression, or deep learning models.
- **Feature Engineering:** Develop advanced feature extraction methods tailored to network traffic analysis.
- **Real-Time Deployment:** Implement a real-time monitoring system with live data feeds.
- **Visualization:** Create dashboards for monitoring and visualizing network threats.
